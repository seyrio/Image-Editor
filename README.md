Edit your images with Image Editor Demon just at the cost of free signup (which your Chrome extensions are trained to handle) (〜￣▽￣)〜.

Simple authentication with local storage, no security, for now, we ain't dealing with FBI forensics.
SignUp otherwise LogIn is always an option.

This demon won't let you do much, it is still powerful so the editor needs more training (new features and lots of code).

The realm lets the user enter (upload) and exit (download/save) images from the local computer.
