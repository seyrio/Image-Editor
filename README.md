Edit your images with Image Editor Demon, a fight between editor and demon in the realm of images, just at the cost of free signup (which your Chrome extensions are trained to handle) (〜￣▽￣)〜.

Simple authentication with local storage, no security as of now. We ain't dealing with FBI forensics.
Sign Up! Otherwise, Log In is always an option.

You can use mock credentials to enter the realm and try the editor.
The close button logs you out and returns to the main page.

This image editor uses @filerobot/image-editor npm package.
